### **CMG: Combinatorial Multigrid** 

Combinatorial Multigrid is a linear system solver for symmetric diagonally dominant systems. 

CMG is originally implemented in **MATLAB**. Find and download the corresponding .zip file [here](https://github.com/ikoutis/cmg-solver/tree/master/downloads).

A **Julia** implementation has been co-authored by Bodhisatta Pramanik. It is hosted [here](https://github.com/bodhi91/CombinatorialMultigrid.jl).

This work has been supported by NSF grant CCF-#1149048
